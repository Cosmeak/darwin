`TODO`: setup docker and continious deployment.

# Contributing

#### 1. Install project on your machine

```sh
# Clone the project or fork it
$ git clone git@github.com:Cosmeak/darwin.git
```

### 2. Setup project

Since the project use deno, all dependencies come from the cache, you don't need to install something other than the deno runtime.

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
```

And then add your own discord bot token .

#### 3. Run the server

The development server use the watcher from deno, you don't need to think about relaunch it. üôÇÔ∏è

```sh
$ deno run dev
```

#### 4. Coding time

All events and command are auto-imported inside the bot, you just need to deploy commands to let discord know about their existence.

```sh
$ deno run command:deploy
```

#### Useful informations

Be careful not to add an already existing event, this can cause an overwrite of one of them.

The command can be place under multiple folder and will still be imported.
